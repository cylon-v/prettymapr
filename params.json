{"name":"Prettymapr","tagline":"Tools for rapid, publication-grade mapping in R","body":"# Prettymapr: Tools for rapid, publication-grade mapping in R\r\n\r\n[![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/prettymapr)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=prettymapr)\r\n\r\nPrettymapr automates the process of creating a scale bar and north arrow in any package that uses base graphics to plot in R. Bounding box tools help find and manipulate extents. Finally, there is a function to automate the process of setting margins, plotting the map, scale bar, and north arrow, and resetting graphic parameters upon completion.\r\n\r\nThe gist of it:\r\n\r\n\r\n```R\r\ninstall.packages(\"rosm\") \r\ninstall.packages(\"prettymapr\") #if these are not installed already\r\n\r\nlibrary(rosm)\r\nlibrary(prettymapr)\r\nosm.plot(searchbbox(\"wolfville, ns\"))\r\nbmaps.plot(searchbbox(\"wolfville, ns\"))\r\n\r\n#or use prettymapr to remove margins and add scale bar\r\nprettymap(bmaps.plot(searchbbox(\"wolfville, ns\")))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFind more information on the [CRAN package page](https://cran.r-project.org/package=prettymapr) or [view the manual](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/prettymapr/prettymapr.pdf).\r\n","google":"UA-73397650-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
